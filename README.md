# CLAIRâ€”Command Line Arithmetic in Rust

CLAIR is a small personal project for exploring the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
It implements arithmetic operations on lines of string (currently only stdin, but support for files as input is planned).
This is inspired by using [`awk`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html) for command line arithmetics.
